# 对象介绍

“We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances
as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement that holds
throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of
our language … we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the
organization and classification of data which the agreement decrees.”<br>
Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897-1941)

我们把自然界分解，构造了新的概念，并赋予意义，大部分是因为我们遵循了一种规约。
这种规约遍布于我们的语言群体，并且定义了语言的模式。
如果没有规约定义的语言组织方法、事物分类原则，我们就无法交流。<br>
Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897-1941)

The genesis of the computer revolution was in a machine. The genesis of our programming
languages thus tends to look like that machine.

计算机演化的起源是从机器开始的，那么编程语言的起源也从类似机器。

But computers are not so much machines as they are mind amplification tools (“bicycles for
the mind,” as Steve Jobs is fond of saying) and a different kind of expressive medium. As a
result, the tools are beginning to look less like machines and more like parts of our minds,
and also like other forms of expression such as writing, painting, sculpture, animation, and
filmmaking. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is part of this movement toward using the
computer as an expressive medium.

但是，计算机也不是绝对的机器化，因为计算机是思维的增强工具（“思维的自行车”，Steve Jobs喜欢这么说），
也是一种特殊的表达媒介。 因此，计算机越来越去机器化，同时越来越像人类的思维，越来越像人类思维的表达方式，
诸如写作、绘画、雕塑、动画和电影。 在计算机作为表达媒介的这个背景下，面向对象编程成为发展方向。

This chapter will introduce you to the basic concepts of OOP, including an overview of
development methods. This chapter, and this book, assumes that you have some
programming experience, although not necessarily in C. If you think you need more
preparation in programming before tackling this book, you should work through the
Thinking in C multimedia seminar, downloadable from www.MindView.net.

本章介绍面向对象编程的基本概念，开发方法。本书假定读者有编程经验，但C开发经验不是必需的。


This chapter is background and supplementary material. Many people do not feel
comfortable wading into object-oriented programming without understanding the big picture
first. Thus, there are many concepts that are introduced here to give you a solid overview of
OOP. However, other people may not get the big picture concepts until they’ve seen some of
the mechanics first; these people may become bogged down and lost without some code to
get their hands on. If you’re part of this latter group and are eager to get to the specifics of the
language, feel free to jump past this chapter—skipping it at this point will not prevent you
from writing programs or learning the language. However, you will want to come back here
eventually to fill in your knowledge so you can understand why objects are important and
how to design with them.
