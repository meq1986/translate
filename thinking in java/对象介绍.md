“We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances
as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement that holds
throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of
our language … we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the
organization and classification of data which the agreement decrees.”
Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897-1941)
